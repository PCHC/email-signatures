          <h3>Email Etiquette</h3>
          <p>
            Good email etiquette is essential for maintaining professionalism in PCHC communications. Here are some tips for keeping your emails clean, concise, and professional:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Don‚Äôt use background images or colors</strong>&nbsp;‚Äî They may look nice to you, but they don‚Äôt always look the same to the recipient. Depending on their email program, some formatting may be stripped out, making your email difficult to read against your background. It also adds unnecessary file size to the email. <strong>Always keep your background white.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Use professional fonts and colors</strong>&nbsp;‚Äî Never use ‚Äúcute‚Äù specialty fonts, such as Comic Sans or Papyrus as your default font, and if you‚Äôd like to change your default font color, try to keep it in the PCHC family of colors. Darker colors work best to maintain readability.</li>
            <li><strong>Don‚Äôt be sloppy</strong>&nbsp;‚Äî Email is a fairly informal means of communication, but should still be treated with more professionalism than mobile texting. Check your grammar,&nbsp;spelling, and punctuation ‚Äî don‚Äôt use abbreviations for common words (such as ‚Äòu‚Äô for ‚Äòyou‚Äô, or ‚Äò2‚Äô for ‚Äòto&nbsp;or too‚Äô), and watch out for commonly mixed up words, such as your &amp; you‚Äôre, its &amp; it‚Äôs, and there, their, &amp; they‚Äôre.</li>
            <li><strong>Keep messages simple</strong>&nbsp;‚Äî Try to keep your email to the point, and focus on one subject whenever possible.</li>
            <li><strong>Use sentence case</strong>&nbsp;‚Äî USING ALL CAPITAL LETTERS LOOKS AS IF YOU‚ÄôRE SHOUTING. using all lowercase looks lazy. Use proper capitlization, and use&nbsp;<strong>bold</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>italics</em>&nbsp;or *asterisks* for any necessary emphasis. Avoid using different text colors to highlight, however, because not everyone‚Äôs email program will display them properly.</li>
            <li><strong>Be careful with Reply All</strong>&nbsp;‚Äî Sometimes everyone needs to be included in a group discussion. Sometimes a mass email only needs a reply sent to the sender. Take some time to think about who needs to see your response before clicking Reply All.</li>
            <li><strong>Use the Subject field to indicate content or purpose</strong>&nbsp;‚Äî Try not to just say ‚ÄúHi!‚Äù or leave it blank ‚Äî an email‚Äôs subject helps the reader know at a glance what your email is about and find it in their inbox at a later time.</li>
            <li><strong>Remember your tone can‚Äôt be heard in email</strong>&nbsp;‚Äî Emotion and tone-of-voice is difficult or even impossible to convey in email, and readers may interpret messages in unintended ways. Keep that in mind before sending an email with some joking sarcasm or other messages that could be misread. Sometimes an emoticon can help to get your tone-of-voice across, but use those smileys sparingly so you don‚Äôt appear unprofessional. üòÄ</li>
